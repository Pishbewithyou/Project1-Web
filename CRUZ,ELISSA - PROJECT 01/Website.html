        <h1>SEASONS</h1>
    </section>
    <p>A time of the year characterized by unique weather conditions is known as a season. 
        The four seasons - spring, summer, autumn, and winter - occur in one another regularly. 
        Each season has brightness, warmth, and atmospheric conditions that recur annually.</p>
